# Bugs Fixed - October 7, 2025

## üêõ Critical Bugs Identified and Fixed

### Backend Issues

#### 1. **Route Ordering Bug in `/backend/routes/tasks.js`**
**Problem:** Express router matched `/my/given`, `/my/accepted`, and `/my/applications` against the generic `/:id` route first, treating "my" as a task ID.

**Impact:** 
- "My Given Tasks" view returned 404 errors
- "My Accepted Tasks" view returned 404 errors  
- "My Applications" view returned 404 errors
- Users couldn't access their personal task lists

**Root Cause:** The `router.get('/:id')` handler was defined before the specific `/my/*` routes. Express matches routes in the order they're defined, so `/:id` captured everything.

**Fix:** Moved all `/my/*` routes (given, accepted, applications) to the top of the file, before the `/:id` handler.

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/routes/tasks.js` (lines 6-62)

---

### Frontend Issues

#### 2. **Missing DOM Container `taskContainer`**
**Problem:** Multiple views tried to access `document.getElementById('taskContainer')` but the element didn't exist in `dashboard.html`.

**Impact:**
- Profile view failed to render (null reference error)
- Leaderboard view failed to render (null reference error)
- "My Accepted Tasks" view had rendering issues
- Console filled with "Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of null" errors

**Root Cause:** The HTML only had `#tasks-grid` but several JS functions expected `#taskContainer` as a parent wrapper.

**Fix:** Added `<div id="taskContainer">` as a wrapper around `#tasks-grid` in the dashboard HTML.

**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/dashboard.html` (line 82)

---

#### 3. **Incorrect API URL Paths (Double `/api/`)**
**Problem:** Profile and leaderboard API calls used `${API_URL}/api/auth/...` resulting in URLs like `http://localhost:3000/api/api/auth/profile`.

**Impact:**
- Profile data failed to load (404 errors)
- User ratings failed to load (404 errors)
- Leaderboard failed to load (404 errors)
- Users saw "Failed to load profile" error messages

**Root Cause:** `API_URL` constant already includes `/api`, so adding `/api/` again created duplicate path segments.

**Fix:** Changed all instances to use `${API_URL}/auth/...` instead of `${API_URL}/api/auth/...`.

**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/js/dashboard.js` (lines 938, 1183, 1286)

**Functions Fixed:**
- `loadProfileView()`
- `loadUserRatings()`
- `loadLeaderboard()`

---

#### 4. **Variable Shadowing in `fetchMyAcceptedTasks`**
**Problem:** Function re-declared `const tasksGrid = document.getElementById('taskContainer')` instead of using the global `tasksGrid` variable.

**Impact:**
- "My Accepted Tasks" view failed to render properly
- Even after fixing the container issue, this function would have had issues

**Root Cause:** Incorrect variable redeclaration and wrong element ID lookup.

**Fix:** Removed the local variable declaration and used the global `tasksGrid` that's already defined at the top of the file.

**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/js/dashboard.js` (line 205)

3. Apply to a task and check "My Applications"
4. Accept an application and view "My Accepted Tasks"
5. Complete a task and verify profile stats update
6. Check leaderboard rankings display correctly
7. Verify all modals (create, edit, rate, comments) work
8. Test rating system after task completion
