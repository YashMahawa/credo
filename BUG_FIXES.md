- `GET /api/tasks/my/given` - View user's given tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/my/accepted` - View user's accepted tasks  
- `GET /api/tasks/my/applications` - View user's applications
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/apply` - Apply to a task
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/accept/:applicantId` - Accept an application
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/reject/:applicantId` - Reject an application
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/complete` - Mark task as completed
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Cancel a task
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/rate` - Rate users after completion

Added profile endpoint in `/backend/routes/auth.js`:
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get current user profile

### 2. **Missing Frontend Functionality** ✅
Completely rewrote `/frontend/js/dashboard.js` with:
- Navigation between different views (Open Tasks, My Given Tasks, My Accepted Tasks, My Applications)
- View task details and apply functionality
- Manage tasks with applications (accept/reject)
- Complete tasks
- Cancel tasks
- Rate users (giving and accepting ratings)

- Navigation menu with multiple views
- Task Detail Modal (for viewing and applying)
- Manage Task Modal (for task givers to manage applications)
- Rating Modal (for rating users after completion)
- Profile Modal (to view user stats)
- Responsive design

### 4. **Database Schema Updates** ✅
Updated `/backend/database.js`:
- Added CANCELLED status to tasks table constraint
- Ensured all status values are validated

### 5. **Missing .env Configuration** ✅
Verified `.env` file exists with:

## Current Status

✅ **Backend**: Running on port 3000
✅ **Frontend**: Running on port 8000  
✅ **Database**: SQLite (credo.db) initialized
✅ **All Features**: Fully functional

## What Was Not Working Before

❌ View & Apply button - no functionality

❌ No way to accept/reject applications
❌ No task completion workflow
❌ No rating system implementation
❌ No way to view your given/accepted tasks
❌ No profile view
❌ No task cancellation

## What's Working Now

✅ Complete task lifecycle: Create → Apply → Accept → Complete → Rate
✅ Full application management system
✅ Rating system with automatic average calculation
✅ Multiple views for different task states
✅ User profile with statistics
✅ Task cancellation
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Security (JWT authentication, HTML escaping)

## Architecture

```
Frontend (Port 8000)
    ↓
Backend API (Port 3000)
    ↓
SQLite Database (credo.db)
```

All communication uses JWT authentication for security.
