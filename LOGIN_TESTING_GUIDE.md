## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### The Problem
```javascript
// BEFORE - Event listeners attached before DOM loaded
const loginForm = document.getElementById('login');  // Returns null!
loginForm.addEventListener('submit', ...);  // Error: cannot read property of null
```

### The Solution
```javascript
// AFTER - Wait for DOM to load first
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const loginForm = document.getElementById('login');  // Now exists!
    if (loginForm) {
        loginForm.addEventListener('submit', ...);  // Works perfectly ✅
    }
});
```
