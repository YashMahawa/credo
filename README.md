## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Make sure port 3000 is not in use
- Check that all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
- Verify `.env` file exists with JWT_SECRET

### Can't connect to backend from frontend
- Ensure backend is running on port 3000
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify API_URL in `frontend/js/dashboard.js` is `http://localhost:3000/api`

### Login not working
- Clear browser localStorage
- Check that username and password match
- Verify backend console for errors

## Notes

- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens expire after 5 hours
- Database file (`credo.db`) is created automatically on first run
- Ratings are automatically averaged and updated in user profiles
