## üéØ Key Features Explained

### Trophy System
- Trophies are awarded when a task is successfully completed
- Only the task doer (acceptor) receives a trophy
- Trophy count is visible on profiles, leaderboards, and throughout the app
- Used as primary ranking metric on leaderboard

### Rating System
- **Task Creator Rating**: How well you create and manage tasks
- **Task Doer Rating**: How well you complete tasks
- Ratings are mandatory when completing, withdrawing, or removing
- One rating per user per task to prevent spam
- Average ratings displayed with star visualization

### Application Status Flow
```
PENDING ‚Üí ACCEPTED ‚Üí (Task Complete) ‚Üí COMPLETED
       ‚Üí REJECTED
       ‚Üí REMOVED (by task creator)
       
ACCEPTED ‚Üí (Withdrawal) ‚Üí REMOVED
```

### Leaderboard Algorithm
```
Ranking = ORDER BY trophies DESC, overall_rating DESC
Overall Rating = (Task Creator Rating + Task Doer Rating) / 2
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
DB_PATH=./credo.db
```

### Frontend Configuration
Update API URL in `frontend/js/dashboard.js` and `frontend/js/auth.js`:
```javascript
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api';
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill existing process
pkill -f "node server.js"
pkill -f "python3 -m http.server 8000"
```

### Database Reset
```bash
cd backend
rm credo.db
npm start  # Will recreate database with migrations
```

### CORS Issues
Ensure backend `server.js` has CORS enabled:
```javascript
app.use(cors());
```

1. Navigate to frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser, or use a simple HTTP server:
```bash
# Using Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# OR using Node.js http-server (install with: npm install -g http-server)
http-server -p 8000
```

## Database Schema

- **users**: User accounts with giving and accepting ratings
- **tasks**: Tasks with status (OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- **task_applications**: Applications from users to tasks
- **ratings**: Ratings given by users after task completion

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Database**: SQLite (local file-based database)

## API Endpoints

### Auth

- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get current user profile

### Tasks
- `GET /api/tasks` - Get all open tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get task details with applications
- `GET /api/tasks/my/given` - Get user's given tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/my/accepted` - Get user's accepted tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/my/applications` - Get user's applications

- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Cancel task
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/rate` - Rate a user after task completion

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Make sure port 3000 is not in use
- Check that all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
- Verify `.env` file exists with JWT_SECRET

### Can't connect to backend from frontend
- Ensure backend is running on port 3000
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify API_URL in `frontend/js/dashboard.js` is `http://localhost:3000/api`

### Login not working
- Clear browser localStorage
- Check that username and password match
- Verify backend console for errors

## Notes

- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens expire after 5 hours
- Database file (`credo.db`) is created automatically on first run
- Ratings are automatically averaged and updated in user profiles
